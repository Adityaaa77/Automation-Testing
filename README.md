Automation Testing Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects and work samples demonstrating my skills in Automation Testing, Manual Testing, Test Case Design, Bug Tracking, and QA processes.
It includes sample automation frameworks, UI test scripts, API tests, and documentation that reflect my ability to ensure software quality through systematic and structured testing.

About Me

I am an aspiring QA Engineer with hands-on experience in executing test cases, identifying and reporting defects, documenting issues, and collaborating with developers to verify fixes.
I have worked with tools and technologies such as Selenium, Java/Python, TestNG, Postman, and defect tracking platforms like JIRA, Bugzilla, and Trello.

This portfolio highlights practical examples of automation frameworks and testing approaches I have implemented.
